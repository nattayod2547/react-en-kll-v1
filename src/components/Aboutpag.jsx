                    Hello! I’m Nattayod Lamsan, and I’m currently diving into the world of web development. I’m learning React, 
                    TailwindCSS, and Node.js to build dynamic and visually appealing web applications. My journey into tech started 
                    with a background in automotive engineering, having graduated with a Vocational Certificate in Automotive Technology 
                    from Techno Lopburi. My passion for technology and problem-solving drives me to continuously learn and improve my skills. 
                    I’m excited about the opportunities ahead and am eager to apply my knowledge in creating innovative solutions.
